### Bugs fixed

**Backspace at column 0 deletes nothing (bug 16b)**
- Pressing Backspace (`\x7f`) while the cursor is at position 0 on a non-empty
  line now deletes the first character (forward-delete), instead of silently
  doing nothing.
- Root cause: `vlib/readline` `delete_character()` returns early when
  `cursor <= 0`. Fix implemented without modifying vlib by replacing the
  `r.read_line()` call with `vlsh_read_line()` — a custom readline loop defined
  in `readline_fix.v` that uses only the public Readline API
  (`enable_raw_mode`, `disable_raw_mode`, `read_char`, `pub mut` fields).

**END key inserts tilde (bug 16)**
- Pressing the End key on terminals that send `\x1b[4~` (VT220/rxvt) no longer
  inserts a literal `~`; it now moves the cursor to end of line.
- Fixed as part of the custom readline loop: `vlsh_analyse_escape()` in
  `readline_fix.v` now handles `\x1b[4~` → `move_cursor_end`, consuming the
  full 4-byte sequence. The standard `\x1b[F` (xterm/VTE) sequence was already
  handled correctly.

### Features added

**Native `.vsh` script support**
- `.vsh` files are now executed automatically via `v run` without any extra syntax.
- Works for absolute paths (`/path/to/script.vsh`), explicit relative paths (`./script.vsh`,
  `../script.vsh`), tilde paths (`~/bin/script.vsh`), bare filenames (`script.vsh` — resolved
  against the current directory), and `.vsh` files found during normal PATH search.
- `use_v_run()` added to `exec/exec.v`: rewrites the command to `v run <vsh_path> [args…]`.
- `find_v_exe()` added to `exec/exec.v`: searches vlsh-configured paths then system `PATH`
  for the `v` binary.
- Relative path execution (`./foo`, `../foo`) was previously broken in `find_exe()`; fixed
  as part of this change.
- New tests added to `exec/exec_test.v`: `find_v_exe`, `use_v_run` (fullcmd + args
  preservation), and absolute-path resolution.
- `README.md` updated with a `.vsh scripts` section under Shell features.

### Bugs fixed

**Tilde expansion (bugs 1–2)**
- `~` and `~/path` are now expanded to `$HOME` in all command arguments and in
  the command name itself (e.g. `vi ~/.config/nvim/init.vim`, `more ~/.vlshrc`).
- `expand_tilde()` added to `exec/exec.v`; applied in `find_exe()` and when
  setting child-process arguments.

**Output redirection (bugs 3–5)**
- `>` (truncate) and `>>` (append) are now supported for external commands and
  for the built-in `echo`.
- `parse_redirect()` added to `exec/exec.v`; strips redirection tokens from the
  argument list and captures the target filename and mode.
- `builtin_redirect()` and `write_redirect()` added to `vlsh.v` for built-ins.

**UTF-8 / multibyte characters in mux (bugs 6–7)**
- Multi-byte UTF-8 sequences (e.g. Swedish å, ä, ö) are now decoded correctly
  in PTY output inside the multiplexer.
- `utf8_buf` / `utf8_rem` state added to `Pane`; `utf8_seq_len()` and
  `utf8_buf_to_rune()` helpers added to `mux/pane.v`.

**AND-chains (bug 8)**
- `cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3` syntax is now supported; the chain stops on the first
  non-zero exit code.
- `split_and_chain()` added to `vlsh.v`; `main_loop` now returns an `int` exit
  code so the chain logic can propagate failures correctly.

**Documentation (bug 9)**
- Full `## DOCUMENTATION` section added to `README.md` covering architecture
  overview, config file format, all built-in commands, shell features (pipes,
  redirection, &&, tilde, env-var prefix, history, tab completion, plugins),
  multiplexer key bindings, and module API summary.

**Mouse support in mux (bug 10)**
- Clicking a pane now makes it active.
- X10 mouse tracking (`\x1b[?1000h`) enabled on mux entry; disabled on exit.
- `do_mouse_click()` added to `mux/mux.v`; `InputHandler` extended with
  `click_col` / `click_row` fields and X10 packet parsing.

**Mux exit message (bug 11)**
- "Exited mux mode" is now printed to the terminal after the multiplexer
  restores the terminal state.

**CTRL+V + o cycles panes (bug 12)**
- `Ctrl+V` + `o` now cycles focus to the next alive pane.
- `do_cycle()` added to `mux/mux.v`; `cycle_pane` action added to
  `MuxAction` enum and `InputHandler`.

**Removed CTRL+V + x (bug 13)**
- The `x` key binding (close pane) has been removed from the prefix map.
  Panes still close automatically when their process exits.

**nvim slow to exit in mux (bug 14)**
- Multiplexer `select` timeout reduced from 50 ms to 5 ms so the PTY write
  buffer drains quickly.
- `do_close()` now tries a non-blocking `waitpid(WNOHANG)` first and only
  sends `SIGTERM` + blocks if the process is still running.

**Background colour erase in mux (bug 15)**
- Erased cells now carry the current SGR (background colour) so that
  applications using BCE (Background Color Erase) — such as nvim — render
  their colour schemes correctly.
- All `J` and `K` erase sequences and `scroll_up()` in `mux/pane.v` now
  use `Cell{ch: ' ', sgr: p.cur_sgr}` for blank cells.

**Global shared command history (bug 17)**
- All shell instances now share a single history file at `~/.vlsh_history`
  (last 5000 entries).
- `load_history()` populates readline's `previous_lines` on startup;
  `append_history()` appends each command and trims the file when it exceeds
  5000 lines.

**VAR=value command prefix (bug 18)**
- Leading `KEY=VALUE` tokens before a command are now detected and temporarily
  set as environment variables for the duration of that command only, then
  unset (e.g. `FIELD_LIST='used,avail' df -h --no-sync .`).
- `is_env_assign()` added to `utils/utils.v`; `main_loop` in `vlsh.v`
  refactored to strip the prefix tokens, set/unset around `dispatch_cmd()`.

**venv command (bug 19)**
- New built-in `venv` manages session-scoped environment variables:
  - `venv add <NAME> <value>` — set a variable for the current session
  - `venv rm <NAME>`          — unset it
  - `venv list`               — list all venv-managed variables and their values
- Tracked variable names are stored in `__VLSH_VENV` (a colon-separated env
  var) so no global state is required.

**Test suite (bug 20)**
- All 7 test suites now pass with 0 failures.
- Fixed stale `input_test.v` test (`x` → `.close_pane` replaced with
  `x` → `.passthrough`).
- New tests added:
  - `mux/input_test.v`   — `o` → `.cycle_pane`, X10 mouse click/release
  - `utils/utils_test.v` — 14 tests for `is_env_assign`
  - `exec/exec_test.v`   — 11 tests for `expand_tilde` and `parse_redirect`
  - `mux/pane_test.v`    — 10 tests for `utf8_seq_len`, `utf8_buf_to_rune`,
                            and multi-byte `feed`
  - `vlsh_test.v`        — 8 tests for `split_and_chain`; 6 tests for
                            `venv_tracked`, `venv_track`, `venv_untrack`
